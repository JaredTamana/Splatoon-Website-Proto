            <h2>Order? Chaos?</h2>
            <p>Nintendo took fans by surprise with the theme of the Final Splatfest for Splatoon 2. Subtitled "Splatocalypse", the theme was Chaos VS Order. The question posed by the hosts was "would it be better if the world succumbed to Chaos, or had complete Order with no free will?"<br><br>In promotional material, various characters were shown alignment to either side. It seemed to many that it was implied that characters from Octo Valley were aligned to Chaos, while characters from the Octo Expansion were aligned to Order.<br><br>

                In the end, Chaos won 3-0. So what does this mean for the future.<br><br></p>
            <h2>Theory 1: Splatoon 3</h2><br>
            <p>Callie and Marie's Final Splatfest altered the plot of the proceeding game, so many fans are quick to jump to the conclusion that the same will happen here, where the story mode will see the world delve into a post-apocalyptic world with no rules. Certainly this makes sense, but it doesn't follow what Nogami has said.<br><br>In 2016, development for the second game in the series was already started when the Final Splatfest was announced. The plot was only changed as they developed the game. With recent <a href=news.html>news</a>, this isn't the case for Splatoon 2. So, what gives?<br><br></p>

            <h2>Theory 2: DLC</h2><br>

            <p>Back when the Octo Expansion was announed, Nogami said it was "the first paid DLC for Splatoon 2". He also later announced that there would be no more single player DLC for Splatoon 2. This has led some to believe that a second DLC is in the works for multiplayer content.<br><br>This is further supported by the development status at Nintendo. Nogami is currently producing the next Animal Crossing game, so he's likely unable to also produce a new Splatoon title simultaneously. With the Nintendo Switch only two years into it's life, it seems unlikely that a new game would be pushed back to as far as the next generation of consoles, but games take time to develop. With a DLC to keep the community alive, the competitive scene around Splatoon that matters so much will continue on.</p>
