            <h2>In a world...</h2>
            <p>...where humans have long perished, sealife has taken over, evolving and growing its' own culture in place. <strong>Jellyfish, urchins, whales, anemones</strong>... and of course, <strong>Inklings</strong> and <strong>Octolings</strong>, all highly intelligent sea creatures that have adapted to their post-dystopian environment.<br><br>

                In modern day, Inkling fashion and pop culture is at its peak. The main pastime of young Inklings, Turf Wars, evolved as a sport inspired by a war long ago between the races of Inkling and Octoling.<br><br>

                You, the player, rise up in rank in Turf Wars, gaining enough money along the way to upgrade your gear and weapons.<br><br></p>
            <h2>What's a Turf War?</h2>
            <p>Despite the serious name, Turs Wars are all in good fun! They are sporting events held between cephalopods with different objectives. Each player's weapon of choice spreads their <strong>ink</strong>, which is coloured to match their team. This ink damages the other team and slows them down -- and if sprayed with it, sends them back to their beginning spawn, pushing them back further from their objective.<br><br></p>
