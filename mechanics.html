            <h2>A different kind of shooter</h2>
            <p>Splatoon's gameplay subverts that of a typical third-person shooter. The characters are able to shoot and then dive into their nearby turf, in the process transforming from humanoid to squid. Diving into ink not only conceals the player, but it also allows for faster <strong>swimming</strong> movement, refilling of weapon ink tanks, and healing. This heavily shifts gameplay to encourage the player to only stay unsubmerged when necessary. Much of Splatoon's strategy comes from learning how to get around quickly and stealthily.<br><br></p>
            <h2>The right tools for the job</h2>
            <p>Due to the steep learning curve of aiming with analog controller sticks, Nintendo decided to make their game more accessible by making <strong>motion controls</strong> their primary method of precise aiming. Most minor adjustments and whip-arounds are done simply by moving the controller. Larger camera movement is done on the x-axis of the right control stick. Players are able to customize the sensitivity of motion controls to suit their needs, and many put the precision on par with a mouse and keyboard. The motion controls have become such a necessity especially in the competitive scene to the point where players who don't use it are often scolded or made the butt of jokes. It takes effort to learn, but it's worth it!<br><br></p>
