            <h2>Online</h2>
            <p>Splatoon is inherently a social experience. From everywhere between unofficial online forums, to in-game social media posts, to integration with Facebook and Twitter, and even integrations with other services like Battlefy that help the competitive community thrive, this may possibly be one of Nintendo's most socially-focused games.<br><br></p>
            <h2>The Competitive Scene</h2>
            <p>Splatoon is one of the three main games Nintendo makes a consistent effort to promote competitive play in, with the others being Super Smash Brothers Ultimate and ARMS. Nintendo holds official tournaments, both invite-only and global, so that fans of the game can compete and show their skills.<br><br>The last competition for Splatoon 2 was the World Championship 2019 in June, where team GGBoyz took home the win for Japan for the second year in a row. You can watch their finals against FTWin in the embed below.</p>
