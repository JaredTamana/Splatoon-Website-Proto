            <p>...humans knew the sea levels were rising. The longest-living known being, Judd the Cat, was sealed in a crygenic chamber by his owner. Not long after this, humans became extinct. For thousands of years, surface life was scarce. Then gave rise to the Inklings.<br><br>

            <p>At some point, sea levels rose again. This caused feuding between the Inklings and their relatives, the Octarians. The fight over the land became known as <strong>The Great Turf War</strong>. The Octarians had the upper hand, but lost due to carelessness. They were banished to Valleys and Canyons while Inklings lived in the higher society.<br><br></p>

            <p>Callie and Marie are two pop superstars who grew up in Calimari Country (no, I am not making this up). They are the artists of a song known to have magical powers, bringing the best out of anyone who hears it. The duo is heralded in Inkling pop culture.<br><br></p>

            <p>A monthy occurence in Inkling culture is the Splatfest. Players choose a side to battle for such as "cats or dogs". These Splatfests were initially held by Callie and Marie, until the two retired from Inkopolis News. As such, they hosted a Final Splatfest, where players were to choose between either of the girls. Marie's team won, causing Callie to go on a trip and subsequently missing.<br><br></p>
